## Accomplishments this week:


What each person was responsible for accomplishing.

  + Naing = Find a way to combine date and time into one column in sql so that sorting becomes easier and more convenient,
  Unit Tests.

  + Sargon = Worked on adding sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc), 
  but will be fully implemented next week (few finishing touches still need to be made).

  + Megan = Edit feature, adding another page for editing as well, flask message, Travis CI, & start on Unit Tests.

  + Jemima = Add due time parameter (we only have date currently), Unit Tests

What was completed.

+ Time and data were combined into one column in sql

+ Edit feature

+ Edit and delete buttons added to tables properly

+ Due time parameter implemented

+ Flask messages

+ Travis CI Implemented

+ Unit Tests for all elements except sorting feature were written

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.

+ We werenâ€™t sure how to correctly approach Unit Tests since we each had different things for 
the Flaskr project. We tried our best to implement each aspect of each other's Unit Test code that
we thought would work best.

+ Several time conflicts, so we were not able to meet as early as we wanted to.

One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

+ The debugging tool was one thing that we used to help us solve minor problems in our code. For example,
we accidentally made changes due to typos in our code. The debugger was able to quickly identify those problems
so that we could move on. 

+ Again, peer programming was really efficient after we all had our completed code. While several things
were functional, it was nice to have others who could help make the code more efficient (getting rid of
unnecessary code, etc). 

What was planned but not finished.

+ Sorting and Unit Test for sorting were not completed. We decided to switch weeks for Account creation and 
unit tests, so Account Creation was not completed as expected. 

What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.

+ We ran into more time conflicts with meeting, so potentially looking at alternative days besides 
Sunday to meet would be very beneficial. 

+ Unit tests made us realize that we could potentially add required fields, so that individuals have to
have at least one field filled before adding a post.

One important thing you learned during this iteration.

+ Each week, we find new benefits to working together. The Unit Test section really helped us to ask each
other questions. We also learned that it is okay to split the work load if one individual is struggling. 
We came across a few instances where it was challenging for an individual

## Plan for Following Iteration (Week 3):

Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

+ "Login" page/function

+ "Create Account" page/function

+ SQL schema

+ Sorting function

+ Filter function (next iteration)

+ Potentially CSS/UI Styling (future iteration)

+ Password protection


Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.

+ The following will be individual work(s) assigned to each team member:

  + Naing = "Login" page and feature

  + Sargon = Continue on implementing sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc) & time zone

  + Megan = "Create Account" page and feature

  + Jemima = SQL schema for account creation
  
+ We will still meet to help with each other's progress, as usual. However, we will
 individually work on each part.
