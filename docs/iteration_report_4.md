## Accomplishments this week:


What each person was responsible for accomplishing.

  + Naing =Create login an signup page for users which includes updating the
  database.

  + Sargon = Worked on adding sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc), 
  but will be fully implemented next week (few finishing touches still need to be made).

  + Megan =Create login an signup page for users which includes updating the
  database.

  + Jemima = Created homepage and added bootstrap to the home page an login page

What was completed.

+ Created user account table in the schema file.

+ login and a signup page along with supporting functions

+ sorting user entries in descending order based on selected category 

+ Home page created, css design added to login and sigup page 

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.

+ Implementing css to an already created html document was a challenge as
the page was formatted without a set design format

+ There were difficulties with login sessions. Users able to create a login
credentials but are unable to logout.
+ The sort button only has one function instead of two i.e sort in ssending out
using different categories. 
+ Including the css impplement in the html file. To resolve the issues, the 
file had to be renamed or pychram restarted. 
One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

+ Again, peer programming was really efficient after we all had our completed code. Two people worked 
together to add a major feature to the application will the remaining to worked
independently. 

What was planned but not finished.
+ Complete login and sorting feature. The login sessions had issues and 
sorting works one way for all parameters. 

What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.

+ We ran into more time conflicts with meeting, so potentially looking at alternative days besides 
Sunday to meet would be very beneficial. 

+ Unit tests made us realize that we could potentially add required fields, so that individuals have to
have at least one field filled before adding a post.

One important thing you learned during this iteration.

+ 

## Plan for Following Iteration (Week 4):

Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

+ "Login" page/function

+ "Create Account" page/function

+ SQL schema

+ Sorting function

+ CSS/UI Styling

+ password protection

+ create a user profile form(used in creating account)


Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.

+ The following will be individual work(s) assigned to each team member:

  + Naing = "Login" page and feature/ SQL schema

  + Sargon = Continue on implementing sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc) & time zone

  + Megan = "Create Account" page and feature / SQL schema

  + Jemima = SQL schema for account creation
  
+ We will still meet to help with each other's progress, as usual. However,Megan 
and Naign would be meeting to work on the login feature.
