## Accomplishments this week:


What each person was responsible for accomplishing.

  + Naing = Create login and signup page for users which includes updating the
  database.

  + Sargon = Worked on adding sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc), 
  but will be fully implemented next week (few finishing touches still need to be made).

  + Megan = Create login an signup page for users which includes updating the
  database.

  + Jemima = Created homepage and added bootstrap to the home page an login page

What was completed.

+ Created user account table in the schema file.

+ Login and a Signup page along with supporting functions

+ Sorting user entries in descending order based on selected category 

+ Home page created, css design added to Login and Sign page 

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.

+ Implementing css to an already pre-styled html document (via bootstrap) classes was some what challenging because some of the styling turned out to be different from what was orignally expected. 

+ There were difficulties with understanding about login/logout sessions in Flask documentation. We will need help from Mark for those materials.

+ The sort buttons only work in one direction for now, which is sorting a column in descending order. We still need to implement the sort function in ascending order if the sort button is clicked again.
+ Including the css implementation for the web page was a problem. Changes to the css files were not reflected on the web page.
 To solove the issue we had to reload with `Shift+F5`

One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

+ Again, peer programming was really efficient after we all had our completed code. Two people worked 
together to add a major feature to the application while the remaining two group memebers to worked
independently. 

What was planned but not finished.
+ Complete login and sorting feature. login sessions where not included and 
sorting works in one way for all parameters(descending order). 

What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.

+ We discovered that we need to include login sessions to enable the users to the web apllication
to login. 

One important thing you learned during this iteration.

+ We are still in the process of learning login sessions. Also we learnt how to 
work with two tables which is was experiences in addition flaskr. 

## Plan for Following Iteration (Week 4):

Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

+ "Login" page/function

+ "Create Account" page/function

+ SQL schema

+ Sorting function

+ CSS/UI Styling

+ unit test for login/logout

+ create a user profile form(used in creating account)


Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.

+ The following will be individual work(s) assigned to each team member:

  + Naing = "Login" page and feature/ SQL schema

  + Sargon = Continue on implementing sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc) & time zone

  + Megan = "Create Account" page and feature / SQL schema

  + Jemima = implement css for account creation
  
+ We will still meet to help with each other's progress, as usual. However,Megan 
and Naign would be meeting to work on the login feature.
