## Accomplishments this week:

What each person was responsible for accomplishing.

+ For this iteration, the team members all met up and peer programmed. Before committing 
the code to the master branch, we each reviewed it.

What was completed.

+ Set up the database

+ Added an HTML template

+ Created an app.py file with functions to initiate, close, and get the database,
show assignments, and add assignments

+ Added a feature that allows the user to select the date

+ Created a README.md file

One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

+ During peer programming, we collaborated when we came across an error.
Especially during debugging, there were four people to think through instead of 
independently figuring the problem out. 

What was planned but not finished.

+ We planned to add a feature that allows the user to select the time. 
We actually tried to implement this during our first iteration, but we ran
into issues that we were not able to solve yet. The issue is also opened in GitHub.

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.

+ We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to configure the environment

+ We had several id problems

+ The time feature we were hoping to implement was not successful

What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.

+ We believe that having two separate pages, one for displaying all of the assignments
and the other for adding new assignments, would be useful. This is one of the 
parts that we want to implement in Iteration 2.

## Plan for Following Iteration (Week 2):

Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

+ Fix issues from week 1

+ Create two pages to display assignments and add new assignments

+ Display data in table form

+ Filter Assignments

+ Delete Assignments

+ Edit Assignments

+ Add category/flag

+ Write up a README report to put in the README.md file

Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.

+ We will partially do peer programming again, mainly to fix issues from week 1. However, there will be some individual tasks as well:

+ Naing = Show assignments in a tab format and correct layout

+ Sargon = Filtering and Deleting assignments.

+ Megan = Creating two pages to display assignments/add new assignments and edit feature

+ Jemima = Add category/flag and write up a README report
