+ Created "Login" page and feature / SQL schema (Still finishing account session)

+ Implemented css for account creation. 

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.

+ Running into trouble a user being logged in and when closing out of window the session ended.

+ Hard for all of us to get together with the Thanksgiving break in the way.

+ When trying to make the sort function flip the order of ascension, having trouble making it flip from its first with if statement.

+ Styling the logout button had issues.

One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

+ One of the approaches that worked very well for us is putting two people on a harder portion of the code,
but also helping if/when other people finish their portion of code. It helps a lot with efficiency.

What was planned but not finished.
+ Sorting function working both ways.

What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.

+ We need to make some of our templates' names more accurate to what they really are.

One important thing you learned during this iteration.

+ Something we need to think about is how we will be able to show certain assignments in the database based on certain
accounts.

## Plan for Following Iteration (Week 6):

Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

+ Description preview

+ "Create Account" page/function (Time Zones)

+ Preview of top 5 assignments due (Date)

+ Alert/reminder through email.

+ CSS/UI Styling

+ unit test for login/logout

+ Color change when past due.


Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.

+ The following will be individual work(s) assigned to each team member:

  + Naing = Designated "Floater", will be helping all around with others code.

  + Sargon = Adding a description preview of descriptions that might be too long.
  
  + Megan = Calendar Layout option for the user who prefers to see assignments on a calendar.

  + Jemima = Adding in the Time Zone entry when creating an account.
