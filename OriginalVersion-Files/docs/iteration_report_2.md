## Accomplishments this week:

What each person was responsible for accomplishing.

+ From last iteration, we realized that peer programming was really helpful and efficient. So, for this iteration, we still did the same, where we looked and coded together on a single big screen.

What was completed.

+ Made separating pages for `show_assignment` and `add_assignment`

+ Showed assignments in a table format

+ Added arrow buttons for sorting in each column header (we will add sorting function to those buttons in next iteration)

+ Figured out how pull/merge requests work. We ran into several issues regarding github branches, merge conflicts, workflow, etc. We spent a considerable amount of time solving those github-related issues.

+ Updated a README.md file

One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

+ As mentioned, peer programming was very helpful again. We wouldn't be able to solve all the issues on our own remotely. Also, we managed to work together to make the code more technically accurate. For instance, the two buttons `Add assignment` and `View all assignments` do not need a `form`, and we edited the code to just use `<a>` for those buttons. Having each person explain their contributions allowed us to help them with the issues they were having too.


What was planned but not finished.

+ Edit feature was not done because we unexpectedly spent most of our time with git/github issues.

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.

+ Again, git/github (specifically merging) was the major obstacle in this iteration.


What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.

+ We are going to meet earlier (we usually meet on Sunday night) from now onwards so that we can have more time to handle unforeseeable issues.

## Plan for Following Iteration (Week 3):

Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

+ Add edit feature

+ Add due time

+ Combine date and time into one column (if that is possible)

+ Add `sort` function for all columns

+ Delete Assignments

+ Add category/flag


Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.

+ Next week will be a combination of both individual and team work. The following will be individual work(s) assigned to each team member:

  + Naing = Find a way to combine date and time into one column in sql so that sorting becomes easier and more convenient. For instance, if two assignments are due the same day, then sort it also by time correctly when we click sort by day.

  + Sargon = add sorting features for all parameters (title, category, etc).

  + Megan = edit feature. Add another page for editing as well. Start on Unit Tests.

  + Jemima = add due time parameter (we only have date currently)
  
+ All of us will research and brainstorm on how to implement "Create Account / Log in" feature. Also, we have to figure out how to send passwords securely over the web
